# UTAirStatsPapers
A collection of documents useful for independently verifying emissions numbers in Utah. I have some very early-stage stuff going on in Excel, but I'm going to be switching to using R going forward.

I'll be adding a separate folder for R stuff, I plan on adding as much detail data as I can about FY2016 and FY2015, including hourly (or more frequent) emissions data for all facilities tracked here, along with hourly monitoring data (or more frequent) from all the Utah-based EPA monitoring stations. The goal being to determine if there are correlations between industrial air pollution trends and air "quality" trends, or rather trends in the underlying bits that make up air quality (CO, SO2, Ozone, etc).
